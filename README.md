# The machine code 🧪
## Key points 🚀
**Machine code** is 

- The language understood by the computer, or more exactly by the **CPU (Central processing unit)**. It was designed to run fast, it uses the binary system in order to achieve a high velocity in the execution of instructions.
- An **instruction** is given by the machine code to the CPU, about memory storage or a computation
- The CPU performs the instruction : A load, a store, a jump... 
- When the CPU want to compute values, it uses the ALU : Arithmetic logic unit. 
- Like the 🧠, it manage memory, compute, store values. 
- Instructions can be given in 8 bits (1 byte), 16 bits (2 bytes), 32 bits (4 bytes), doesn't matter for the machine code, it will always understand binary.

 *N.B : Machine code is the lowest language readable by programmer. But micro code is a lower language used by processors to transform programs into micro-operations.*

# The assembly code 🧪
## Key points 🚀
Assembly code is : 
- **Low level language** designed for a specific processor, x86 in our example.
- **Kathleen Booth** 👩‍💻 created what we call the "Assembly code" which is really a symbolic way to represent machine code.
- Assembly language is **easier** to write than machine code. Assembly language can understand sequences of Characters, Sequences of numbers.

- The following are instructions written in Assembly.
  - MOV - move data from one location to another
  - ADD - add two values
  - SUB - subtract a value from another value
  - PUSH - push data onto a stack
  - POP - pop data from a stack
  - JMP - jump to another location
  - INT - interrupt a process

- In order to convert your assembly code in machine code you need an **Assembler** :Gear:

* N.B : You can improve your overall code effiency by using it, specifically if you want a particular task to be done in a certain way. You can achieve a high level of sophistication.*
